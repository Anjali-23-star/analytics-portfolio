#Overview
This project uses the sakila sample database to practice core SQL concepts such as joins, aggregation and gain aware querying.

#Approach
I explored the dataset through a structured set of 10 questions, focusing on:
- Identifying correct grain
- Understanding entity relationships
- Observing the result set and sharing insights about the observed field.

# Sample questions
- Which customers generate the highest rental revenue?
- How does rental volume vary by film category?
- Which stores perform better and why?

(Full write-up linked below)

# Key Takeaways
- Gained fluency with joins and groupings
- Learned to reason about grain and entites before writing SQL
